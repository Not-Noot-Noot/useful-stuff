Hello it's me @Not-Noot-Noot, So the rules for this repo are very complicated:

1- Rule one, you can use my code I don't mind :D
2- Use my code ethically and I am not responsible for anything that happens to you because of my code, You have been warned
3- Now for the most important of all: Have fun as coding is about learning and developing:
    "Reading is how we learn and Writing is how we understand uniquely quote"
