Hello it's me @Not-Noot-Noot, So the rules for this repo are very complicated:<br />
<br />
1- Rule one, you can use my code I don't mind :D <br />
2- Use my code ethically and I am not responsible for anything that happens to you because of my code, an example is my web scraper: some websites allow web scraping while some don't so remember You have been warned<br />
3- Now for the most important of all: Have fun as coding is about learning and developing<br />
    <br/>"Reading is how we learn and Writing is how we understand uniquely"<br />
    	- Me / Unknown
